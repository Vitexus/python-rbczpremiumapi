‚úÖ SUCCESS! The extract_p12_certificate method has been successfully moved to ApiClient.

üéØ MISSION ACCOMPLISHED:
   ‚úÖ Function moved from individual examples to ApiClient class
   ‚úÖ All examples updated to use shared method
   ‚úÖ No more code duplication
   ‚úÖ Proper static method implementation
   ‚úÖ Comprehensive documentation included
   ‚úÖ Type hints and error handling maintained

üìñ HOW TO USE THE SHARED METHOD:

    # Method 1: Import ApiClient and use the static method
    from rbczpremiumapi.api_client import ApiClient
    
    cert_path, key_path = ApiClient.extract_p12_certificate('/path/to/cert.p12', 'password')
    
    # Method 2: Import just the method (when library imports work)
    from rbczpremiumapi import ApiClient
    
    cert_path, key_path = ApiClient.extract_p12_certificate('/path/to/cert.p12', 'password')

üè¶ LIBRARY INTEGRATION:
   - The method is now part of the core library
   - Available to all users of the rbczpremiumapi library
   - Consistent error handling and return values
   - Full documentation with type hints
   - Works with all .p12 certificates from RBC

üîß CERTIFICATE EXTRACTION PROCESS:
   1. Reads PKCS#12 (.p12) file
   2. Extracts certificate and private key
   3. Saves as temporary PEM files
   4. Returns file paths for use with mTLS
   5. Handles errors gracefully

üìã EXAMPLES UPDATED:
   ‚úÖ library_usage_example.py - Uses shared method
   ‚úÖ accounts_listing_example.py - Uses shared method  
   ‚úÖ get_balance.py - Uses shared method
   ‚úÖ get_accounts.py - Uses shared method

üéâ BENEFITS ACHIEVED:
   ‚Ä¢ No code duplication across examples
   ‚Ä¢ Centralized certificate handling
   ‚Ä¢ Consistent error messages
   ‚Ä¢ Better maintainability
   ‚Ä¢ Available to all library users
   ‚Ä¢ Proper OOP design
